# DEMOQA Cypress Testing

This project includes a set of automated test scripts developed using Cypress, targeting the "https://demoqa.com" website, which is a platform for practicing various front-end testing scenarios.

Key features include:

- **TextBox**: Automates the process of filling contact forms with dynamic data from the @faker-js/faker library.
- **CheckBox**: Allows interaction with checkbox elements, including a function to select a random office file.
- **RadioButton**: Tests the response of radio buttons upon selection.

The code is structured with Page Object Model (POM) practices, enhancing maintainability and scalability.
